## INTRODUCTION AND PROBLEM STATEMENT 

Humans have always been curious creatures who seek to explore beyond their expected demographic this curiosity has led to a lot achievements which has not only
made life a lot easier but has led to discoveries that would revolutionize how we live and give us more options for habitations beyond our present habitable
planet that is Earth. This planetary curiosity is the platform in which space missions was birthed. 
In this project, I thought to carry out an exploratory analysis of space missions from (1957 -2022) and to build a captivating story behind space missions
using the following parameters;
•	How many space missions have been carried out between 1957-20220
•	How many countries have participated in this space discoveries
•	How many rockets have been deployed
•	How many companies have been involved
•	Total amount spent on space travels
•	What is the success and failure rate, is there a reason why
•	What are the Top 5 countries, companies, and rockets that have participated in space missions
•	Average money on space spent across years on space missions

We will further dive deeper into other space mission knowledge and at the end of this project you will not only have developed a love for outer space 
but you will also understand the beauty of outer space and the impact on humanity at large.
This dataset was gotten from Maven Analytics and contains the following columns:

1.	The company column which contains the records of companies that have participated in the space missions
2.	**The Date:** This column contains the dates for each mission
3.	**The Time:** This column contains the time for each mission
4.	**The Rocket:**  It shows the names of the rockets used for each mission
5.	**The Mission:**  Shows the title or name of each rocket
6.	**Rocket status:** Shows the status of the rockets, if it is still in service or has retired or no longer in use
7.	**Price:**  Shows the price of each mission
8.	**Mission Status:** This column shows if the mission was successful or not successful
9.	**Location:** Shows the location in which the rockets was launched.




Now we have identified the different columns represented in the dataset, we will further look at the steps I took in making the data ready for analysis – 
In analytical terms These steps are called Data Cleaning and Modelling.
